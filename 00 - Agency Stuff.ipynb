    "> Prefix the pairing session by setting expectations and goals. It’s easy to assume that everyone you’re pairing with has the same expectations for the pairing session. This is not always the case! I often want to blow through the tasks at hand as quickly as possible; but my pair wants to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying themes or part of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Identify your natural inclination. If your pair knows your tendencies, they’ll be more likely to adapt their pairing style to fit your tendencies, and vice versa. Don’t be afraid to say “Hey, I really like to understand what’s happening or I start to panic” or “I can’t stand sitting still for too long or I start to freak out.” Both are reasonable!\n",

    "> While you are pairing, the number one thing to keep in mind is “Is my pair engaged?” or “Am I engaged with my pair?” usually the person that’s driving will be more engaged, and switching it is one technique to help bring yourself or your pair back into the action.\n",
